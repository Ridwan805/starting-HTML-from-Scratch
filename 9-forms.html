<!--Forms come in every shape and form (pun intended). From buying something online to using a search engine, forms are a part of everyday digital life.

They're pretty straight-forward:

- The user enters some information.
- The user presses a “Submit” button.
- And something happens!-->

<!DOCTYPE html>
<html>
    <head>
        <title>What is form?</title>
    </head>
    <body>
        <!--To create form we use <form> tag and it has two attributes
            action and method.
            action attribute says where the form daa should go after it is submitted.
            method attribute is how the data is processed
            but for here we won't use action and method but the forms will still render-->
        <form>
            <!--we use <input> element as an interactive control for entering data.-->
            <input type= "text">
            <input type="submit" value="Submit Form!">

        </form>
    </body>
